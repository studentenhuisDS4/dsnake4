# Generated JSON Schema's
This folder contains generated schemas from typescript-json-schema npm package. We run this with `generate-schemas.ps1` within the `dsnake4-phaser/utils` folder. This is optional and only if you want to manually edit schemas. When the typescript definition is changed, it's adviced to regenerate the schema so it matches.
